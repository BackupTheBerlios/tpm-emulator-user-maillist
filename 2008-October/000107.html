<PRE>Hi,

I'm having some difficulty using the TPM Emulator for certifying keys 
bound to PCR values.  The emulator works in other respects (and has been 
very useful, thanks!), but consistently fails on this operation.  I 
discovered the problem using the JTSS libraries from IAIK, and first 
contacted them (see the attached email).  However, they think the 
problem might be with the emulator instead.

There are a few things I've spotted and tried to code around while 
debugging this error.  However, I still can't make it work 
successfully.  I've been comparing results to those generated using an 
Infineon TPM.  Ultimately, the validation of authorization values is 
failing.  Before that, however, there are some other issues:
 * The TPM_PCR_INFO structure returned appears to be given the wrong 
length (PCRInfoSize in the TPM_CERTIFY_INFO structure).  It reports at 
56 bytes but ought (I think) to be 44.
 * The outData operand (signature on the CertifyInfo) also appears to be 
a strange size.  Although it reports to be 256 bytes, it is actually 
268.  I'm not sure where the spare 12 bytes came from.  Does it have 
anything to do with the extra 12 bytes given in the size of the 
TPM_PCR_INFO stucture?

Finally, having tried to mitigate these issues, the  validation of the 
output authorization against the input fails (within the JTSS TSP this 
is the 'validateRespAuth' method).

Any suggestions for solving this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Many thanks,

John
