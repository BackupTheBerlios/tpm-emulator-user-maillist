<PRE>Hi, all,

First, thanks for Zhang's reply.:)

I had done the building process again with your advice, however, it
still can't work. The warnings remain there. 

So I want to ask that is there anyone successes in building the
tpm_emulator of kernel-2.6.15-1.2054_FC5? If someone did, could you
please give me some hints?

To Mario:

   Could you tell me the proper Linux distribution I should work on for
the tpm_emulator?  I think this will be helpful for me.

 

Back to the question, I wonder if I can find a way to solve the two
warning problems directly.

First one:

WARNING: could not find /tpm_emulator-0.4/crypto/.libgmp.a.cmd for

/tpm_emulator/crypto/libgmp.a

 

Where can I find the file /tpm_emulator-0.4/crypto/.libgmp.a.cmd?

Is the file created during the building process?

Second one:

***WARNING: &quot;__stack_chk_fail&quot; [/tpm_emulator/ tpm_emulator.ko]
undefined!

 

Ok, we try define this in the kernel file.

All the suggestions will be great thankful.

 

Best regards 

Gong
