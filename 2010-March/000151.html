<PRE>... found it! :-) sorry ... but it is hard to work ... and on the book i
have, it wasn't really clear how the error was returned ... so, now i have
understood that the command Tspi_TPM_Quote, not only returns a TSS_ERROR
(one of the 3 listed in its man page), but indeed could also return an error
message related to other layers ... in this case i have done some researches
in the /usr/include/tss/*error.h and found that my error was related to the
TCS layer, and inside of it, it was related to an invalid key ... now i'll
work on it. Sorry for the futile posting on the mailing list. I'll triple
check every future question before posting it here :-)

There is still one problem, with the error codes ... but now i think its
really related only to the trousers (tss) group.

Bye,
Daniel.

&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i continue having problems with some programs i'm developing ... now a
</I>&gt;<i> problem arises, and i already spent a few days trying to solve it, so, here
</I>&gt;<i> it comes:
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> i try to call a Tspi_TPM_Quote operation, but it returns without success,
</I>&gt;<i> returning a dec value of 8389 ... hex 0x20C5, and i haven't found it
</I>&gt;<i> anywhere else, so, i really don't know what to do right now. I'll post this
</I>&gt;<i> message on both mailing lists, of tpm_emulator-user and of tss_users, hoping
</I>&gt;<i> to receive some advice.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> So, thanks in advance ...
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Daniel.
